### Hi, I'm Timothy!
<img alt="Timothy's GitHub Stats" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=timothy2105&show_icons=true&theme=github_dark&" align="right">

I am a Computer Science and Management Science & Engineering undergraduate at Stanford University. I plan to further my studies in AI and software development through research, tinkering with personal ideas, and collaborating with amazing people who are just as passionate about tech as I am! 

For the next few months, I'll be working on a project that builds on Theia, the project that uses ESP32 WiFi signals to ping people through walls. I'm also concurrently working on a simple LLM project that integrates modern transformers, as well as other small projects. Keep an eye out for more updates!
